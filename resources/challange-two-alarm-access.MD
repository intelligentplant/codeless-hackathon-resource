## How to acquiring A&E data

1. **Start Power BI and open the Industrial App Store Connector**<br />
The connector is certified and distributed by Microsoft with Power BI updates :fire:. Just click Get data and look for Industrial App Store data connector.

5. **Fill in parameters**<br />Fill the following values for the required paraemters.

| Parameter  | Value                             | Description                                                                                               |
|------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tag name   | ORE Catapult/Levenmouth/Soe/0-30. | We utilise meta tags to retrieve data from A&E store. More information is available [here](https://github.com/intelligentplant/IAS-Power-BI-connector#using-alarm--evnet-meta-tags-alarm_clock "Industrial App Store - Using Alarm & Event Meta Tags").                 |
| Start Data | *-30d                             | You can enter relative or absolute dates. Use the following format for absolute dates `2020-08-01T00:00Z` |
| End Date   | *                                 | You can enter relative or absolute dates. Use the following format for absolute dates `2020-08-01T00:00Z` |

6. **Load data**<br />Hit apply, tick the checkbox next to the function and hit *Load* to start working on the data in Power BI.<br />
The query should result into a similar result seen below.

> NOTE: This connects to the source historian on site to retrieve data :fire:. If you used *relative* timestamps in your data query this means your result data set will always be up to date.

## How to get data in Power Automate :zap:

- You utilise pre-defined challange templates found on [Microsoft Power Autoamte Portal](https://flow.microsoft.com/).

![Start Industrial App Store Connector](https://intelligentplant.com/datasheets/powerplatform/resources/ias-pp-automate-flow-templates.jpg)

- Or you can create your own flow by following [this](https://github.com/intelligentplant/codeless-hackathon-resource/blob/master/resources/get-data-into-power-platform.MD#power-automate-zap "Industrial App Store - Get data into Power Automate") step by step guide :hourglass_flowing_sand:. For this you'll need to know which tags you want to interogate and the following value for qualified data source name (this is a qualified data source name for on-site historian).

For **process** data use

```text
FBF94704A9C213490B00CFD213C6CDB41653A7E8461EE9AA43871BDD6B4795D2.Edge Historian
```

For **A&E** process data use

```text

You can easily create Bad Actor report or even extarct Sequence of Events data for further analysis or simple display purposes. See [here](https://github.com/intelligentplant/IAS-Power-BI-connector#using-alarm--evnet-meta-tags-alarm_clock "Using Alarm & Event Meta Tags - Catapult Offshore Renewable Energy") how to formulate a request the A&E data.
